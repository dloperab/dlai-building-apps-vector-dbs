# [DeepLearning.AI] Buildings Applications with Vector Databases course

Personal notes and code for the **DeepLearning.AI** course [Building Applications with Vector Databases](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-applications-vector-databases/).

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Poetry
* Pinecone API Key

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash

3. Run the desired notebook.

# Lesson 1: Semantic Search

Semantic search is a type of search that focuses on the meaning of the content being searched, as opposed to lexical search, which looks for literal matches or pattern-matched strings.

This is an extremely powerful concept that underlies much of what we see in text-oriented generative AI applications.
